    To the love of my life,<br><br>
    You are one of the best gf I had ever
    its not like i am comparing you or something dont be mad 😭
    And by staying with you i always realise its too hard for me to handle this long distance yet i never felt unloved
    yeah there were times where i did hurt you the most and i promise i wont repeat that shit ever again
    I am sorry for whatever or however i treated you that made you cry but i promise i wont do it again
    and there were times too when i always think why someone so beautiful like you fall for someone that looks like shit
    yet I never found that answer and also you are too good too sweet for someone like me and i cant even lie about not liking it
    whenever i am with you, you always keep me happy the way you treat the way you laugh the way you do that cute lil things
    which are so adorable that it makes me fall in love for you even more and dont worry
